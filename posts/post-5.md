Front-end development is a crucial aspect of web development, focusing on the creation and design of user-facing features on a website or web application. In today's world, where the majority of people access the internet through their phones, tablets, or laptops, front-end development has become more important than ever. The primary goal of front-end development is to enhance the user experience by providing a visually appealing, easy-to-use, and responsive interface.

There are three primary components of front-end development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the backbone of every web page, and it provides the structure of the content. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to define the visual style and layout of the page, while JavaScript is used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the page.

## HTML

HTML is the most fundamental part of front-end development. It is the language used to create the structure and content of a web page. HTML is a markup language, which means it uses tags to define the different elements on a page. Here is an example of a simple HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>My Website</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
	<p>This is an example paragraph</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## CSS

CSS is used to define the style and layout of a web page. It allows developers to control the appearance of individual elements, such as font size, color, and positioning.

```css
h1 {
	font-size: 32px;
	color: #333;
}

p {
	font-size: 16px;
	line-height: 1.5;
}
```

## JavaScript
